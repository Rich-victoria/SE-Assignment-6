Example: (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c'), (1, 'a', True)
Dictionary (dict):

Represents a collection of key-value pairs.
Example: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}, {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}
Set (set):

Represents an unordered collection of unique items.
Example: {1, 2, 3}, {'a', 'b', 'c'}
# Integer
age = 25
print("Age:", age)
print("Type of age:", type(age))

# Float
pi = 3.14159
print("Pi:", pi)
print("Type of pi:", type(pi))

# String
greeting = "Hello, World!"
print("Greeting:", greeting)
print("Type of greeting:", type(greeting))

# Boolean
is_active = True
print("Is Active:", is_active)
print("Type of is_active:", type(is_active))

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Numbers:", numbers)
print("Type of numbers:", type(numbers))

# Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)
print("Type of coordinates:", type(coordinates))

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "is_student": False}
print("Person:", person)
print("Type of person:", type(person))

# Set

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   - Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. The most common conditional statement is the if-else statement.
   if condition:
    # code to execute if condition is true
   elif another_condition:
    # code to execute if another_condition is true
   else:
    # code to execute if none of the above conditions are true

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   - Functions in Python
   Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to encapsulate functionality, making your code more modular, readable, and maintainable. Functions can take input in the form of arguments and can return output as a result.

   Key Benefits of Functions:

   Reusability: Write once, use multiple times.
   Modularity: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
   Readability: Makes code easier to read and understand.
   Maintainability: Easier to update and manage code.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   -  Differences Between Lists and Dictionaries in Python
   Lists:

   Ordered: Elements are stored in a defined order and accessed by index.
   Mutable: Elements can be modified, added, or removed after creation.
   Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   Dictionaries:

   Unordered: Elements are stored in an unordered manner and accessed by keys.
   Mutable: Key-value pairs can be modified, added, or removed after creation.
   Example: person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   - 
   Key Components:
   try: This block contains the code that might throw an exception.
   except: You use this block to handle specific exceptions that occur in the try block.
   finally: This block executes cleanup code, whether an exception occurred or not (optional).


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    -  File I/O in Python
   File I/O (Input/Output) operations in Python allow you to interact with files on your computer's filesystem. You can read data from files, write data to files, and perform various operations like appending to files or modifying existing content.

   Reading from a File
   To read from a file in Python, you typically follow these steps:

   Open the File: Use the open() function to open the file in the desired mode ('r' for reading).

   Read from the File: Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to read the content from the file.

   Close the File: Always close the file using the close() method to free up system resources.
